                <p>
                    The cosmere is a multi series interconnected fantasy universe created by Brandon Sanderson. It takes place over multiple books and book series, including the Mistborn series, the Stormlight Archive series, and many other books. You can imagine it as similar to the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe), where every character, setting, and story, took part in a greater story with a greater arching narrative throughout that connected all the characters and stories together, but instead of movies, these stories take place in the novels that Brandon Sanderson writes.

                <p>
                    The cosmere is well known for its complex world building, deep magic systems and mechanics, and interesting characters. Over the course of more than 20 years, Brandon Sanerson has expanded upon the cosmere in over 20 novels across multiple worlds, each with their own history, magic systems, cultures, religions, characters and politics. The depth of all of these is one of the main reasons that fans of Brandon Sanderson read his books, as he masterfully blends all these into weaving stories of conflicts of mythic scale and intrigue. It is easy to see why Brandon Sanderson has become one of the most prominent and popular authors in fantasy within the last few years.
