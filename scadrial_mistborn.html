            <h2>The world of Mistborn</h2>
            <p >
                Scadrial is the planet or system on which the Mistborn and Mistborn Era Two series take place. The land is dominated by a red sky with falling ash created by the nearby Ash Mounds, dormant volcanoes that are constantly spewing ash into the sky and blanketing everything in soot, and ruled by a cruel and tyrannical god king known as the Lord Ruler. Under the rule of the Lord Ruler, the common people, known as the Ska, are oppressed and abused by the noble class who run the commercial interests of the Final Empire under the watch of the Lord Ruler and his Canton of Inquisition. At night, the air is filled with mist, obscuring everything in deep white clouds of fog that hide all from sight. Some are said to be blessed with magic powers from this mist, granting them strength, agility, and other magic powers. These are the Mistborn. The story of Mistborn follows Vin, a Ska urchin who is taken in by a thieving crew with a mission: kill the Lord Ruler, and steal his treasury. The story is thrilling, featuring many lovable characters, with twists and turns that any reader of fantasy will love.
