                The story of the Stormlight Archive takes place on the planet of Roshar, a planet dominated by a massive storm known as the Highstorm that crosses the entirety of the planet from the Origin out in sea from the east and travels across the whole of the land until it dissipates in the west. Bringing with it both life and death, the entirety of the planet and its inhabitants have evolved to withstand the devastating winds, strong enough to send boulders flying, and the rain, strong enough to flood a building in seconds, of the Highstorm. The people of Roshar live in a variety of nations and kingdoms, all with deep histories and varied cultures, from the beautiful but brutal Alethi, known for their talent in art and also their prowess in war, to the Azish, who rule rely on bureaucracy and rules to govern and guide their nations and lives. The story of The Stormlight Archive follows three main characters, each distinct from each other but all with incredible and unforgettable stories. There's Kaladin, the soldier turned slave, forced to risk his life and the lives of his friends in an endless war against a nation of betrayers, Shallan, the daughter of a noble house in dire straits, sent to study under one of the most prominent and powerful scholars in the world, but secretly intending to steal her most valuable asset from her to save her dying house, and Dalinar, the brother of an assassinated king, leading his noble house in an endless war of vengeance corrupted by greed and idolatry. The story of the Stormlight Archive is full of mystery and history, and is a treat for any reader who has a love for Epic Fantasy of epic proportions.

                Kaladin was raised to be a surgeon, but through an unfortunate twist of events he finds himself a slave in a war on the Shattered Plains. He is forced to risk his life in Bridge Four, a crew of slaves forced to carry bridges that allow the armies of the Alethi to cross the many chasms spanning the plateaus of the Shattered Plains. Though he was once a very talented soldier, he now faces death and the death of his crew members every day at the hands of enemy archers as they run their bridges in the frontline, praying they will be spared one more day.

                Dalinar Kholin, also known as the Blackthorn, is the most renowned General in the Alethi Army. Despite his years, he is a formidable force on the battlefield, but lacks much skill outside of battle. This becomes a problem when he begins to receive visions from the Almighty, visions of calamity and a great destruction to come, and a command to Unite Them. However, his kingdom is entrenched in a war for vengeance far from their homeland of Alethkar out on the Shattered Plains against the Parshendi, a nation who, five years prior, had assassinated the Alethi King, Gavilar Kholin.
